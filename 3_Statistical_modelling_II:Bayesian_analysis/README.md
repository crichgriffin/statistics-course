Statistical modelling II: Bayesian analysis
=====================================

MODULE AIM:
The aim of the module is to ensure that the students familiarise with the principles of Bayesian statistics and of Bayesian modelling and that they are able to apply such techniques on real data problems.

OVERALL MODULE LEARNING OUTCOMES:
By the end of this module, students should be able to: 
•	Understand and explain the components of Bayesian models - including the prior, likelihood and posterior distributions.
•	Use R to build Bayesian models and perform Bayesian inference.
•	Describe the necessary tools for model checking and comparison and be able to implement those in R.
•	Describe the basics of simple parameter estimation procedures.

PREREQUISITES:

* Students should have a basic knowledge of statistical models and likelihood inference

FILES:
Introduction to Bayesian statistics.pptx: the lecture will start with this power point which will be completed by the students during the course.

Introduction to Bayesian statistics_teacher.pdf: completed pdf (teacher version) of Introduction to Bayesian statitsics.pptx.

practical_nb.1.pptx: this power point will be used to introduce practical 1 (in R)

practical_nb.1.R: the R file corresponding to practical 1

practical_nb.1_answers.R: the R file corresponding to practical 1 with answers


ASSESSMENT:
There is no formal assessment for this course. However, an active participation is desired. 

FORMATIVE FEEDBACK: 
Practical sessions always offer great opportunity for receiving formative feedback from the tutors – weekly office hours will be available to those with further questions and remarks. Brief group discussions will be incorporated in some of the lectures to further evaluate students’ progress and insight.
